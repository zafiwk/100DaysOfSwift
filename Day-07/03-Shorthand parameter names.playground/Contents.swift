}

// However, Swift knows the parameter to that closure must be a string, so we can remove it:
travel { place -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// It also knows the closure must return a string, so we can remove that:
travel { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// As the closure only has one line of code that must be the one that returns the value, so Swift lets us remove the return keyword too:
travel { place in
    "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// Swift has a shorthand syntax that lets you go even shorter. Rather than writing place in we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closureâ€™s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.
travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}


// Examples
// When passing a closure as a function parameter, which of these statements are true?
/*
 Shorthand parameters are written as $0, $1 and so on
 
 If there is only one line of code, you can skip writing return
 
 Swift automatically provides the $ variables; we don't define them ourselves
 
 When using shorthand parameters you don't list the parameters you accept
 
 Swift can infer the return type
 
 Swift can infer the parameters the closure accepts
