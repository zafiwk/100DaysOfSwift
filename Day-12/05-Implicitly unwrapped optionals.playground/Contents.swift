let age: Int! = nil


// Examples
/*
 Swift uses nil to represent the absence of a value.
 
 A String! does not need to be unwrapped before use.
 
 If you try to use an implicitly unwrapped optional when it is nil, your code crashes.
 
 You can use if let or guard let to unwrap optionals.
 
 A String? must be unwrapped before use.
 
 Optionals allow us to represent the absence of a value.
